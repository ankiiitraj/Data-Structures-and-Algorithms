- ## Definition:

  Order of growth determines the general behaviour of an algorithm when the input size is large.

- ## The limitation of order of growth analysis:

  The input might never reaches to a large value.<br/>
  For smaller values of n, generally we don't need order of growth analysis.

- ## Direct way to compare order of growth

  1. Ignore lower order terms
  2. Ignore leading constants

- ## Lower order terms :

  constant < log(log(n)) < n<sup>1/3</sup> < n<sup>1/2</sup> < n < n<sup>2</sup> < n<sup>3</sup> <
  n<sup>4</sup> < 2<sup>n</sup> < n<sup>n</sup>
